# Singly Linked List Implementation in Python 🐍

This repository contains a clean and modular implementation of a **Singly Linked List** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in Python. The project demonstrates how to create a custom linked list class, manage nodes dynamically, and handle edge cases gracefully.

---

## 📌 Features

- ✅ `Node` class to represent each element in the list  
- ✅ `LinkedList` class with methods to:
  - Add a node to the end
  - Print the entire list
  - Delete the **n-th node** (1-based index)
- ✅ Exception handling for:
  - Deleting from an empty list
  - Index out-of-range errors
- ✅ Simple and understandable test cases

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Data Structures (Linked List)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Error Handling in Python
- Dynamic Memory Management
- 1-based Indexing Logic
